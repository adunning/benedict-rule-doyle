# The Rule of St Benedict, translated by Leonard Doyle

Electronic text of *Benedictâ€™s Rule for Monasteries*, trans. Leonard J. Doyle (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1948). In the public domain due to non-renewal of copyright in the United States; original available through [HathiTrust](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005043180). This is the most readable translation free of copyright restrictions; the 1952 [translation by Justin McCann](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000082135660) is also available and in some ways preferable, but it is written in a slightly archaizing style.

This text is also available through the [Order of St Benedict](http://www.osb.org/rb/text/), but this version contains several errors, and its moderization makes it unsuitable for the purposes of historical study.
