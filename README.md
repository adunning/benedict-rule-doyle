# The Rule of St Benedict, translated by Leonard Doyle

Electronic text of *Benedictâ€™s Rule for Monasteries*, trans. Leonard J. Doyle (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1948). In the public domain due to non-renewal of copyright in the United States; original available through [HathiTrust](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005043180). This is the most readable translation free of copyright restrictions; the 1952 [translation by Justin McCann](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000082135660) is also available and in some ways preferable, but it is written in a slightly archaizing style.

This text is also available through the [Order of St Benedict](http://www.osb.org/rb/text/), but this version contains several errors, and its modernized form makes it unsuitable for the purposes of historical study.

Encoded in [Project Gutenberg RST format](http://epubmaker.pglaf.org). The handout version of the text was created with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for teaching purposes. To recreate the PDF, use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and LaTeX, with the command `pandoc rule.md -sS --template=handout.tex -V linenos -o rule-handout.pdf`. The template uses the [`tufte-latex`](https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex) package, and has been modified slightly from a version by Caleb McDaniel.
